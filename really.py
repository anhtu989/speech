Certainly! Here are a few style changes you can make to the `.py` file content to improve readability and maintainability:

1. **Add a docstring**: Provide a brief description of what the script does.
2. **Use a main function**: Encapsulate the main logic in a function.
3. **Add a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block**: This ensures that the script can be imported without running the main logic.
4. **Add comments**: Explain the purpose of the code.

Hereâ€™s the updated content:

```python
"""
A simple Python script to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
"""

def main():
    """
    Main function to execute the script's primary functionality.
    """
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Execute the main function when the script is run directly
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Docstring**: Added a docstring at the top of the file to describe the script's purpose.
- **Main Function**: Encapsulated the `print` statement in a `main()` function to make the code more modular.
- **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block**: This ensures that the `main()` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.
- **Comments**: Added comments to explain the purpose of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

These changes make the script more professional and easier to understand, especially as it grows in complexity.
