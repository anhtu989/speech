Hereâ€™s an updated version of the `.py` file with added documentation (docstrings) and comments to improve readability and maintainability:

```python
# hello_world.py
# This script prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
# Last updated: 2025-03-04 01:56:04

def print_hello_world():
    """
    Prints the classic "Hello, World!" message to the console.
    
    This function is a simple demonstration of a basic Python script.
    It is often used as the first program when learning a new programming language.
    """
    print("Hello, World!")

# Entry point of the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_hello_world()
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a function `print_hello_world()` to encapsulate the logic of printing the message.
2. Added a docstring to the function to describe its purpose.
3. Added comments to explain the script's purpose and the entry point.
4. Updated the timestamp comment to reflect the latest update.

This version is more modular and adheres to best practices for Python code documentation.
