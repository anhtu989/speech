The provided `.go` file is already quite clean and adheres to Go's coding conventions. However, I can suggest a few additional refactoring changes to further improve readability and maintainability:

1. **Add a comment to describe the `main` function.**
2. **Use a constant for the message string to avoid hardcoding.**
3. **Add a newline before the `main` function for better separation.**

Hereâ€™s the updated content:

```go
// main.go
// This is a simple Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

const message = "Hello, World!"

// main is the entry point of the program.
// It prints a predefined message to the console.
func main() {
	fmt.Println(message)
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Comment for the `main` function**: Added a comment to describe the purpose of the `main` function.
2. **Constant for the message**: Introduced a constant `message` to avoid hardcoding the string directly in the `fmt.Println` call. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to update if the message changes.
3. **Newline before `main` function**: Added a newline before the `main` function to visually separate it from the imports and constants, improving readability.

These changes enhance the structure and maintainability of the code while keeping it simple and easy to understand.
