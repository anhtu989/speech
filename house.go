Certainly! Here are a few style changes you can make to the `.go` file to improve readability and adhere to common Go coding conventions:

1. **Add a comment at the top to describe the purpose of the file.**
2. **Use consistent spacing and indentation.**
3. **Add a newline after the package declaration and imports for better readability.**

Hereâ€™s the updated content:

```go
// main.go
// This is a simple Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Comment at the top**: Added a comment to describe the purpose of the file.
2. **Spacing and indentation**: Ensured consistent spacing and indentation.
3. **Newline after package declaration and imports**: Added a newline after the package declaration and imports to improve readability.

These changes make the code more readable and maintainable while adhering to Go's style guidelines.
